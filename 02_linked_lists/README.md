## Linked Lists

#### Remove Duplicates

Given the head of a sorted singly-linked list, write a function that returns a modified list which does not contain any nodes with the same value. The linked list should be modified in place.

#### Return Nth to Last

Given a positive integer n, write a function to find the nth to last element of a singly-linked list.

- What should we return if n is greater than the length of the linked list? _Null_
