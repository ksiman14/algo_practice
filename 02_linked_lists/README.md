## Linked Lists

#### Remove Duplicates

Given the head of a sorted singly-linked list, write a function that returns a modified list which does not contain any nodes with the same value. The linked list should be modified in place.

#### Delete Node

Given a node in a singly-linked list (NOT the head of the linked list) that is not the tail node, write a function remove the node from the linked list. Do not return anything from the function, just modify the linked list.

#### Return Nth to Last

Given a positive integer n, write a function to find the nth to last element of a singly-linked list.

Ex: (1 -> 2 -> 3, 2) -> 2

- What should we return if n is greater than the length of the linked list? _Null_

#### Is Palindrome

Given the head of a singly-linked list, return true if the list is a palindrome, false if not.

Ex: (1 -> 2 -> 1) -> true
Ex: (1 -> 2 -> 3) -> false
