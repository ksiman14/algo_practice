## Strings

#### isUnique

Write a function to determine if a string has all unique characters.

- Should the function be case-sensitive? _No_
- What should the function return for an empty string? _true_

#### isPermutation

Given two strings, write a function to determine if they are permutations of each other.

- Should the function be case-sensitive? _Yes_
- What should the function return for two empty strings? _true_

#### Palindrome Permutation

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome (a word/phrase that is spelled the same forwards and backwards).

Ex: 'carcear' -> true ('carcear is a permutation of 'racecar')

- Is an empty string a palindrome? _Yes_
- Is a string with one character a palindrome? _Yes_
- How should we treat spaces? _Ignore spaces_
- How should we treat special characters? _Assume the string contains no special characters_
- Should the function be case-sensitive? _No_
