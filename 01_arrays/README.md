## Arrays

#### Two Sum

Given a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target, determine whether any two numbers in the array add up to the target. If true, return the two numbers in array. Otherwise, return an empty array.

- Could there be multiple pairs that add up to the target? _No_
- Can we assume the target will be defined? _Yes_

#### Binary Search

Given a sorted array of integers and a target integer, use a Binary Search algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array. If the target is included in the array, return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

- Should it return -1 for an empty array? _Yes_
- Can we assume the target will be defined? _Yes_

#### Rotate Matrix

Given an NxN matrix, write a function to rotate the matrix IN PLACE by 90 degrees.

Ex: [[1, 0], [0, 1]] -> [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
